# Sasebo Spots
February 2017

### A map of cafes, shops, and places I frequent in Sasebo, Japan.
The street names in Sasebo aren't always clearly marked so it can be a challenge to find your way back to a favorite shop if you don't make note of where you are. The map linked below uses GPS data to map some of my favorite places to shop in Sasebo.

Tip: If you have the address, you can use http://www.gps-coordinates.net/ to find longitude and latitude.
